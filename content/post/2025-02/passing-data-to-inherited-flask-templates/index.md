## Use Case

Letâ€™s say you have a web application that uses authentication and you need to pass on some properties of the user object to the navigation element to display it when heâ€™s connected.

You probably put this navigation in the `layout.html` (or `base.html` as you may encounter).

Now, letâ€™s say the user information is stored in the session, for example in `session['user']`.

How do you display it in the navigation?

## Solution

With Flask 3 comes a special decorator: `context_processor`.

```python
@frontend.context_processor
def inject_user():
    user = session.get('user', None)
    if user:
        username = user.get('name', 'User')  # Default to 'User' if name is not found
    else:
        username = None
    return dict(username=username)
```

Note: in the example below, Iâ€™m using modules to organize my Flask application. So the `@frontend` means Iâ€™m in the `app/modules/frontend` and since I need this only for frontend pages, Iâ€™ll put it at the top of my `routes.py` inside this module.

Now, in the `layout.html`, you simply use a condition to display the userâ€™s name when itâ€™s available:

```html
<nav class="theme-color">
  <div class="custom-nav-wrapper container">
    <a href="{{ url_for('frontend.index') }}">My Awesome App</a>
    <ul>
      {% if username %}
      <li class="username">Hello, <strong>{{ username }}</strong>!</li>
      {% endif %}
      <!-- The rest of your navigation -->
    </ul>
  </div>
</nav>
```

## Other Usage

Now that you have this context available, you can access it everywhere in the templates.

For example, in another page where you would record comments, the author of the comment shouldnâ€™t have to input his name.

Now, you can use the same logic as above.

I have a second tip for this article. In my scenario, I had set the input to be required and the user had to type it.

When I implemented that, I thought Iâ€™ll set the `disabled` attribute on the input. Nope! Thatâ€™ll not send the value to Flask, if you submit the form the old fashion way (Yes, I do ðŸ˜Š).

I rarely used the attribute `readonly` that does the job.

So the input looks like that:

```html
<label for="note_author">Author</label>
<input
  type="text"
  class="form-control"
  id="note_author"
  name="note_author"
  value="{% if username %}{{ username }}{% endif %}"
  readonly
/>
```

And a bit of CSS provides good feedback to the end user :

```css
input[readonly] {
  background-color: #ccc;
}
```
